    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the chicken with the ingredients listed under ‘marinade’. Cover and set aside or refrigerate (ideally) up to overnight. When ready to use, allow the chicken to come to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Thoroughly wash the rice and soak it in water. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat a large, heavy-bottomed pan over high heat. Add the oil, ghee, and onions and sauté until the onions are golden (~15-20 minutes). Deglaze the pan with ¼ cup water. Once the water dries up, add the whole spices, garlic, and ginger and sauté for another 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken with its marinade and sauté until it changes color (~2-3 minutes). Add the tomatoes, green chili pepper, and dried plum (alu bukhara) and stir to coat. Add ½ cup water (the water should cover about 1/3 of the chicken) and bring to a gentle boil.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat down to a gentle simmer (this is low heat on my stovetop), cover, and allow the chicken to cook for 30 minutes, stirring midway. While the chicken is cooking, proceed to the next step. Turn off the heat once the chicken has cooked.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare the rice. Place a medium pot over high heat and bring 7 cups (1.75 quarts) of water to a boil (See Tip). Add salt, oil, and lemon juice/vinegar and stir. Once the water comes to a boil, drain and add the rice. Stir, and bring it back up to a boil. Once it comes to a boil again, boil for 5 minutes (no more than 5 minutes and 30 seconds), or until the rice is just cooked with a bite to it. It shouldn’t get mushy when pressed between your fingers. (See Note 1) Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Uncover the chicken. Raise the heat to medium-high to sauté out any excess water for 2-3 minutes. Add salt, garam masala, and red chili flakes for more heat (if desired). The oil will have separated from the ‘masala’. Turn off the heat. Add kewra water and lemon juice and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>To assemble the biryani, spread a layer of cooked rice at the bottom of a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven. Arrange the cooked chicken on top of the rice, followed by another layer of rice. Repeat this process until all the ingredients are used up, ending with a layer of rice on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook over low heat for 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and the flavors have melded together.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and let the biryani rest for 5-10 minutes before serving. Garnish with chopped cilantro, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
